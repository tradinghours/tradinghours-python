## Setting Up Local Environment

### Clone the Repository

Starting from scratch, go into a test folder and follow these steps to set up the code locally. This will clone the repository, switch to the desired branch, and set up the Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tradinghours/tradinghours-python.git

cd tradinghours-python

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate  # on Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # on Unix or MacOS

pip install -e .
```

You can now use the package from this directory.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, you need to install the development requirements (e.g., `pytest`):

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]

pytest
```

### Running with a Database

If you want to run it with a MySQL or Postgres database, create a `tradinghours.ini` file in the current directory with the connection string:

```ini
[data]
db_url = mysql+pymysql://test_user:test_password@localhost:3306/test_db
```

Then, install the appropriate dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[mysql]  # or pip install -e .[postgres]
```

If you don't have one of these databases available, you can run a Docker container defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up mysql -d  # for MySQL
# or
docker compose up postgres -d  # for PostgreSQL
```

When done, don't forget to shut it down:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## CI/CD Workflow

### Overview

The CI/CD process uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and releasing the project. The workflow includes several steps described below:

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR) against `pre-release`:**
   - This will trigger the `tests.yml` workflow.
   - If all tests pass, merge with the `pre-release` branch.

2. **PR against `main`:**
   - Increment the version number in `src\tradinghours\__init__.py`.
   - Describe the changes in `release_log.txt` under the `## new_release` heading. (But keep the heading as it is)
   - Open a PR from the `pre-release` branch to `main`.
   - This will trigger the `test_release.yml` workflow.
   - If the tests pass, merge with the `main` branch.

3. **Automatic Release:**
   - Merging with `main` triggers the `release.yml` workflow.
   - This will push to PyPI and create a release tag on GitHub.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### `tests.yml`

This workflow runs tests across different configurations including coverage, database integration tests, and various OS and Python versions.

#### Trigger

The workflow is triggered on pull requests to the `pre-release` branch.

#### Sections

1. **Coverage**
2. **Database Tests**
3. **OS Versions and API Levels**
4. **Python Versions**

### `test_release.yml`

This workflow ensures that the package can be pushed and pulled from the test PyPI repository before an actual release.

#### Trigger

The workflow is triggered on pull requests to the `main` branch.

#### Steps

1. **Push to Test PyPI**:
    - Checks if the version has been incremented.
    - Releases the package to Test PyPI.
2. **Test from Test PyPI**:
    - Installs the package from Test PyPI.
    - Runs all tests to ensure the package works as expected.

### `release.yml`

This workflow publishes the package to PyPI and creates a release on GitHub.

#### Trigger

The workflow is triggered on push events to the `main` branch.

#### Steps

1. **Update Version and Summary**:
   - Sets the version and updates the release log.
2. **Build and Publish**:
   - Publishes the package to PyPI using Flit.
3. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Creates a new GitHub release with the current version and summary.
